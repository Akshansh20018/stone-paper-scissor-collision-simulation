Possible avenues to expand:
    AI and Machine Learning
        Smart elements: Implement basic AI for elements to make strategic decisions.
        Learning algorithms: Use machine learning to evolve element behavior over multiple simulations.

    Multiplayer and Interaction
        User intervention: Allow players to add or remove elements during the simulation.
        Multiplayer mode: Create a version where multiple players can compete by influencing their own set of elements.
        Vs Mode: Player plays a classic game with the computer and if they win 10 copies of their element is added to the game and losers 10 are subtracted 

    Different Modes:
        Orbs mode: Create a version with orbs, where some might have shield and spear
